Once it has completed its action, if appropriate, it may put an event back into the event stream to trigger a downstream or dependent microservice.This sequence allows microservices to function without causing dependency failures. I.e. a failure in one microservice should not be allowed cause the whole system to fail or to cause cascading errors.Each microservice will need to include an event listener to respond to relevant events in the event stream for the microservice.There are many code libraries available for interacting with Apache Kafka.",
