# Microservices

The Directory of Service is built with a microservices architecture.

The project is currently in an Alpha phase, and the current system design is intended for the purposes of experimentation and testing rather than a practical design for use in a production environment.

For example, for expedience in technical experimentation, all of the data is currently stored in a single microservice. In future, this will be separated out into separate microservices tailored to the functioning of each data set.
