# User Interface Prototypes

The user interface prototype explores how we might make information validation quicker and less effort in a directory of service.

It presents potential solutions for raising the visibility of out-of-date service information, which would allow a service steward to quickly take action.

## Repository

Code for the DoS UI prototype is in the [https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/dos-prototype](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/dos-prototype) repository.

## Technology Platform

The UI prototype is a NodeJS app.
