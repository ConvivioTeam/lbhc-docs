# Docker Workflow

## Production Docker Images

There is a key difference between development use and production use.

Production images should be packaged with the source code and everything required to run on it's own.

## Storage

Docker images can be stored on either [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).
